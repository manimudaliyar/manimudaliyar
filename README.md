# Hi, I’m Mani 👋

I’m an engineer transitioning into **DevOps**, focused on building systems that are automated, observable, and boring in production (the good kind).

I’m an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)**, but I care more about workflows, reliability, and repeatability than shiny dashboards.

### What I’m Working On 🔧
• Linux and Bash for day-to-day automation  
• Git and GitHub for clean, reviewable workflows  
• Applying AWS architecture patterns through hands-on projects  
• Learning how real DevOps teams reduce failure, not just deploy faster  

---

### DevOps Mindset 🧠
• Infrastructure should be reproducible  
• If it’s manual, it’s technical debt  
• Logs, metrics, and alerts beat guessing  
• Simple pipelines > clever pipelines  

---

### Tools in My Orbit 🛠️
Linux • Bash • Git • GitHub • AWS  
Docker • Terraform • CI/CD (actively learning)

---

### Current Status 📍
Certified → Automating → Breaking → Fixing → Improving
