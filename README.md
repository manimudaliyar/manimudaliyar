# Hi, I’m Mani 👋

I’m an engineer moving deeper into **DevOps & Cloud Engineering**, focused on building systems that are automated, observable, and boring in production (the good kind).

I’m **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** and I care more about workflows, reliability, and repeatability than shiny dashboards.

## What I’m Doing Right Now 🔧

• Linux and Bash for day-to-day automation  
• Git and GitHub for clean, reviewable workflows  
• Applying AWS architecture patterns through hands-on projects  
• Learning how real DevOps teams reduce failure, not just deploy faster  

---

## DevOps Mindset 🧠

• Infrastructure should be reproducible  
• If it’s manual, it’s technical debt  
• Logs, metrics, and alerts beat guessing  
• Simple pipelines > clever pipelines  

---

## Tools in My Orbit 🛠️

Linux • Bash • Git • GitHub • AWS  
(Docker, Terraform, CI/CD coming in hot 🔜)

---

## Current Status 📍

Certified → Automating → Breaking → Fixing → Improving
