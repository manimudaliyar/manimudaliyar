# Hi, I’m Mani 👋

I’m a systems-minded engineer transitioning into **Cloud & DevOps**, with hands-on experience in Linux, Git, and AWS fundamentals. I care about reliability, automation, and building things that don’t break at 3 AM.

Currently sharpening my skills around infrastructure, scripting, and cloud architecture, with a strong focus on learning the *why*, not just the *how*.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

• Strengthening Linux fundamentals and Bash scripting  
• Version control and collaboration using Git & GitHub  
• Building small, practical projects to understand real-world DevOps workflows  
• Expanding cloud knowledge with AWS services and architecture patterns  

---

## 🧠 What I Believe In

• Automate first, document always  
• Simple systems scale better  
• Read the docs, then read them again  
• If it’s not reproducible, it’s not done  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Operating Systems**  
Linux (Ubuntu), Windows  

**Version Control**  
Git, GitHub  

**Cloud (Learning & Practicing)**  
AWS  

**Scripting & Automation**  
Bash  

*(More coming as I build and ship projects)*

## 📌 Goals

• Become job-ready for Cloud / DevOps roles  
• Build production-style projects, not tutorial clones  
• Develop strong fundamentals before chasing tools  
• Contribute to open-source when ready
